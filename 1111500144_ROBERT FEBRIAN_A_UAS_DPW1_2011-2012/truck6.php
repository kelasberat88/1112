      <p align="left" class="style2">The clock  was winding down at a rapid clip when we faced the fact that we had no truck  picked out for this month's cover of Sport Truck and just a week left in our  production schedule. We needed a miracle to occur if we were going to make our  deadline, and we needed it fast. Miracles don't come easy when few trucks we  pass on the street possess the look, style, and performance of a cover truck,  so you can imagine our horror when trying to find and photograph one at the  last minute. Thankfully, a close-knit group of friends and truck customizers  came together for the cause of putting together a truck worthy of the Sport  Truck cover and did so in last-minute buzzer-beater fashion. This truck was  literally assembled, painted, and detailed by some outstanding folks in just  under a week. Here's how everything went down.</p>
      <p align="center" class="style2"><img src="images/0508st_12_z+2000_chevrolet_silverado+custom_gas_tank.jpg" width="140" height="186" /> <img src="images/0508st_10_z+2000_chevrolet_silverado+kolor_kings.jpg" width="140" height="105" /> <img src="images/0508st_08_z+2000_chevrolet_silverado+custom_interior.jpg" width="140" height="105" /> <img src="images/0508st_05_z+2000_chevrolet_silverado+custom_wheel.jpg" width="140" height="105" /></p>
      <p align="left" class="style2">The drama  unfolded after we called Marcel Venable of Venable Koncepts/Huntington Beach  Line-X because we had previously spied an incredible, albeit half-finished,  Chevy sitting in his shop for several weeks. The prospect of scooping the other  mags on a truck with as much style as this one was enticing enough, but the  trouble was, the truck wasn't finished. After explaining our predicament and  that this particular truck was close to being ready for the cover, but not  quite (it was sitting on stock wheels and tires and with a stock-looking engine  compartment), he hung up the phone with us and then jumped on his cell phone  again to do what he does best: circle the wagons and get project trucks  handled. Within a matter of days his shop was teeming with friends and builders  - including the truck's owner, Jared Fullmer, the talented fabricator who  crafted the custom chassis and air suspension that lays this standard-cab  show-stopper on the pavement - all working together in harmony to finish this  truck under the gun. Chris Coddington came through in huge style and got the  ball rolling by whipping up a custom set of 22-inch billet rollers in just  three days, and Toyo tires let us raid its warehouse to find some ultra-skinny  rubber. This meant the truck was now driveable but nowhere near ready for  photos. With just three days left, the crew soldiered on, with Jared driving  four hours down from Fresno to help out.</p>
