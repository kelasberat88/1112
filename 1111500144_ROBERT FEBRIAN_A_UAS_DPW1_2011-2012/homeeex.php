            <span class="style10"><br />
          Great shows  take on a life of their own. Typically they are jam-packed with entertainment  and loaded with an overflowing collection of custom trucks. They become a  gathering place where you can meet old friends and celebrate good times.  Slammin' and Jammin', now in its 16th year, has become one of the top  summertime shows in the East. The James E. Ward Agricultural Center in Lebanon,  Tennessee, has welcomed the event since its inception, providing tree-lined  display spaces, a burnout pit, and an open-air pavilion for all the weekend  action. This year more than 8,500 folks arrived for the Memorial Day weekend  reunion, enjoying the noisy and smoky burnout competition, the wild hydraulic  exhibition, live musical entertainment, and the Slik Chix girls demonstrating their  wrestling skills in baby oil!</span></span><br />

        <p class="style5"><span class="style9"><span class="style10">Five years is a long  time to build a Chevy S-10, even one as nice as this one. Short of the truck  being involved in a bad accident, there usually isn't a bunch of restoration  work needed before the custom work can begin because these contemporary  mini-trucks aren't rust buckets. While Mark Hernandez did have the good fortune  of starting with a clean truck, he still spent a lot of time fixing mistakes  and changing his mind, which held up the build big time. After two paintjobs,  three different sets of wheels, two 'bag jobs, two sets of seats, and three  audio systems, his truck still isn't finished but he's learned a lot and is  happy at long last</span>.</span><br />
